## User Story

After a long day working form home tapping away at the computer, your dogs barking for fuss and the 24rd amazon parcel has just been delivered. Our user waddles to the kitchen and open the fridge to find a mishmash of ingredients. He’s overwhelmed and too tired to think. He decides maybe cooking is not an option tonight and goes and collapses on the sofa and falls asleep in front of Netflix.
If only our user had access to “yummy Fridge” he could have easily told it what main ingredients he had in his fridge and recipes would start flying out of his device. No need to think, no need to be overwhelmed just follow the simple instruction and he presto, dinner is served !! No more hungry nights !
Thinks of this scenario playing over and over across the nation. A nurse coming home from a night shift, a mum after putting her toddler to sleep or our poor university student after a night out on the town.
